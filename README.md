# WattTours-Ontology
This coursework involved developing a SPARQL ontology in Protégé to represent the needs of a fictional tourist agency called WattTours.

# About
In Stage 1, each group member developed his own version of the ontology.
In Stage 2, group members had to collectively discuss each of their ontologies and develop an agreed ontology. They then had to query the ontology together with an external knowledge graph.

Finally, members were required to draft a report that includes the contributions of each group member, the discussions that led to the consolidated design, documentation of the ontology and the required queries run along with their output.
